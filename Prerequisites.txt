Before implementing and running the codes of this repository,You should follow these procedures step-by-step.
*******************************************STEPS FOR CONFIGURING YOU RASPBERRY PI(3/3B+/4)  ***********************************
Install Raspbian buster lite on your raspberry pi.You can download the raspbian buster lite by visiting the link below:
[download raspbian page]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/    -   Select raspbian buster lite from this download page and extract the zip file in any folder.
Now you need to burn your memory card (should be atleast 8 GB) with the raspbian buster lite.For this 
win32 disk imager is recommended.If you are using a linux system then you need to make the memory card bootable by burning 
the raspbian buster lite using rufus (some linux distros have the utility to make memory card/pen drive bootable).

Now plug in the memory card in the memory card slot(in the back) of your raspberry pi and then power it on(you'll need
Type C connector for raspberry pi4).Connect the peripherals.
If you are using only the headless raspberry pi then you need to connect it using ssh (though I have not tried).I have 
connected 7-inch raspiscreen through HDMI cable(you will need microHDMI cable for raspberry pi4).

After powering it on you will see the pi booting up and finally terminal login will show up.Type "pi" (without "") for the username
and "raspberry" (without "") for the password (default username and password of raspberry pi).

Connect it with the internet.(Raspberry pi has inbuilt wifi;Type `sudo raspi-config` in terminal then go to `Network Options` -> `Wi-fi`).
Configure your wifi there by typing the ssid and password.You can also directly connect you internet connected mobile phone to usb 
 port of pi via USB TETHERING.
 
 Now ping in to check whether internet is connected(Type `ping google.com` in terminal).Type `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` 
 to update the repository list and update the obsolete packages to latest one.
 
 For upgrading the current terminal to gui type `sudo apt-get install raspberrpi-ui-mods` in the terminal.After completion,type
 `sudo raspi-config` then select `Boot Options` -> `Desktop/CLI` ->`Desktop Autologin`.Then reboot.

********************A SMALL HACK*****************
Those guys who are from college then generally a captive-portal opens for login before connecting to internet.
So,they can try the LYNX cli-browser by typing `sudo apt-get install lynx` in the terminal and then running the lynx by entering 
`lynx` in the browser.Type IP address of captive portal there and then login.(I was mesmerised trying the cli-browser and its working.)
